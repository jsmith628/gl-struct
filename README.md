# GL-Struct

Safe but transparent wrappers for the OpenGL API

This crate aims to provide a safe wrapper for OpenGL with minimal overhead
and while mirroring the original API as faithfully as possible.

At the moment, the project is in a pretty big state of flux and in the process
of an overhaul, so don't expect the API to remain the same. The most recent
stable version is still on the `master` branch, but the current state of the
rewrite is on `testing`.
